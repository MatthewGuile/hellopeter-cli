The person who called me did explain mostly what entailed that my installment would be reduced.  However no mention of the relevant charges. I had to go into a branch to confirm and the consultant also didn’t know so we had to call collections and they advised I would only be responsible for the reduced instalment. I thought great at least I will be able to bring down my outstanding balance substantially.  I was pretty clear with the consultant as to what I needed to know if the relevant charges would be charged ie the interest, death and disability and monthly charge.  Maybe they didn’t understand the line of enquiry.  Needless to say on the statement date all the charges went off my credit card thereby reducing the instalment I had made.  What was the point of suspending the Card couldn’t use it anyway as it was maxed. So they “saving” me R120 on installment.  I’m going to re-double my efforts to pay off all my outstanding debt with them and then close the account.  I have other bank accounts don’t really need another.
