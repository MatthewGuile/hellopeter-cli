However, my experience quickly turned into a nightmare. Since Saturday, 22 February 2025, my Bank Zero card has not been working—I cannot withdraw cash, swipe, or even access my banking app.

To make matters worse, I have been unable to reach Bank Zero's customer support. None of their contact numbers seem to work, and when I search for help online, the number provided redirects to a software developer company—completely unrelated to banking!

This has caused me serious inconvenience and financial stress. I have an investment payout pending, and because I cannot rely on Bank Zero, I have had to open an account at another bank, which has cost me additional time and money.

I am extremely disappointed with Bank Zero's service (or lack thereof). If this is how they treat customers, I cannot recommend them. A bank with no working customer support and unreliable services is unacceptable. I regret opening an account with them.

It's the cheapest of the banks for my banking needs and I already have a Capitec account but needed a second account. Bank Zero has exceeded my expectations! I find it better than African Bank and even Tyme bank. Their bank charges are cheaper, and because they don't use a call center, your issues are sorted on Whattsapp which is cheaper and quicker than calling. I get free, excellent and speedy service for both me and my business with Bank Zero. The only downside is that no one but the card holder can deposit cash into your account. Cash deposits are done at a POS and you need your bank card card to do it. If you want someone to deposit cash, they have to have your card.

﻿
﻿1. My salary got delayed because Standard Bank used the wrong code for Bank Zero.
﻿
﻿2. I tried the cash send function, only for the person to collect the money at Shoprite to see that it could not be collected due to an error between Bank Zero and Shoprite.
﻿
﻿3. After years of testing, immediate payment launches fail miserably on me. FNB and Standardbank immediate payments had issues, so I had to transfer them to my discovery and then to the end user. This has happened three times to me now. They promised me at one stage that immediate payments would launch within 10 days maximum, but it also did not happen back then.
﻿
﻿4. The fact that public payments cannot be made was also a bummer.
﻿
﻿5. I had to jump through hoops for MTN to load Bank Zero on the debit order. The system did not pick them up as a bank.
﻿
﻿6. A lot of times Bank Zero is not existent as a Bank. Tried Old Mutual before for something and also could not find Bank Zero.
﻿
﻿7. Yesterday I tried buying a Voda pay voucher for Panarotti's. Guess what, did not work twice. Some Cryptogram error. Had to use my wife's Capitec account to buy it trying once. No issues.
﻿
﻿8. They lack innovation and are behind all banks at this point including new banks like Tyme Bank. No digital stuff like Google Wallet, rewards systems, etc.
﻿
﻿Reported all these issues but they don't even have the decency to come back to me with feedback on what went wrong and why. Also did not advise when it was fixed either.
﻿
﻿Don't get me wrong there are nice features like blocking unwanted debit orders, Tracking efts, etc. But with all the issues I had with them, I seriously don't know if I can trust them as my main bank.
﻿
﻿It feels like I will wake up one day and my money will be wiped due to a glitch or something. 
﻿
﻿I guess they are cheap for a reason. You pay for what you get. I tried being positive with all my replies on Mybroadband, But today I just had enough of this **** service. 
﻿
﻿When a bank cannot even do basic banking right it does not matter if they pay me to use their service. One day they will let me down big-time example when I need money to pay for hospital or other medical stuff.
