However, my experience quickly turned into a nightmare. Since Saturday, 22 February 2025, my Bank Zero card has not been working—I cannot withdraw cash, swipe, or even access my banking app.

To make matters worse, I have been unable to reach Bank Zero's customer support. None of their contact numbers seem to work, and when I search for help online, the number provided redirects to a software developer company—completely unrelated to banking!

This has caused me serious inconvenience and financial stress. I have an investment payout pending, and because I cannot rely on Bank Zero, I have had to open an account at another bank, which has cost me additional time and money.

I am extremely disappointed with Bank Zero's service (or lack thereof). If this is how they treat customers, I cannot recommend them. A bank with no working customer support and unreliable services is unacceptable. I regret opening an account with them.

Their bank charges are cheaper, and because they don't use a call center, your issues are sorted on Whattsapp which is cheaper and quicker than calling. I get free, excellent and speedy service for both me and my business with Bank Zero. The only downside is that no one but the card holder can deposit cash into your account.

﻿
﻿1. My salary got delayed because Standard Bank used the wrong code for Bank Zero.
﻿
﻿2. I tried the cash send function, only for the person to collect the money at Shoprite to see that it could not be collected due to an error between Bank Zero and Shoprite.
﻿
﻿3. After years of testing, immediate payment launches fail miserably on me. FNB and Standardbank immediate payments had issues, so I had to transfer them to my discovery and then to the end user. This has happened three times to me now. They promised me at one stage that immediate payments would launch within 10 days maximum, but it also did not happen back then.
﻿
﻿4. The fact that public payments cannot be made was also a bummer.
﻿
﻿5. I had to jump through hoops for MTN to load Bank Zero on the debit order. The system did not pick them up as a bank.
﻿
﻿6. A lot of times Bank Zero is not existent as a Bank. Tried Old Mutual before for something and also could not find Bank Zero.
﻿
﻿7. Yesterday I tried buying a Voda pay voucher for Panarotti's. Guess what, did not work twice. Some Cryptogram error. Had to use my wife's Capitec account to buy it trying once. No issues.
﻿
﻿8. They lack innovation and are behind all banks at this point including new banks like Tyme Bank. No digital stuff like Google Wallet, rewards systems, etc.
﻿
﻿Reported all these issues but they don't even have the decency to come back to me with feedback on what went wrong and why. Also did not advise when it was fixed either.
﻿
﻿Don't get me wrong there are nice features like blocking unwanted debit orders, Tracking efts, etc. But with all the issues I had with them, I seriously don't know if I can trust them as my main bank.
﻿
﻿It feels like I will wake up one day and my money will be wiped due to a glitch or something. 
﻿
﻿I guess they are cheap for a reason. You pay for what you get. I tried being positive with all my replies on Mybroadband, But today I just had enough of this **** service. 
﻿
﻿When a bank cannot even do basic banking right it does not matter if they pay me to use their service. One day they will let me down big-time example when I need money to pay for hospital or other medical stuff.

I just opened a Pty Ltd and needed to open a business bank account. I tried for several days to get information from the 5 major banks in SA. It was so difficult to find the right person to speak to and get clarity on their banking fees. As an exasperated last resort I thought, why pay exorbitant banking fees to banks who don't offer good customer service. I'll try Bank Zero.. My experiese so far; They respond to email and whatsapp queries within a few hours if not quicker. The business account setup (which first requires that you open a normal bank account) was seemless. I uploaded the registration documents and within 24 hours I had a bank account. The card was printed and delivered to my nearest clicks for collection. So my experience so far is great but a few features would make this a better user experience: You cannot add multiple scheduled payments to the same beneficiary. I have multiple properties that I need to pay municipal rates for. So I need to manually enter the payment reference into the beneficiary payment on the app. It was time consuming as well as tricky typing in the small space. I do like internet banking on a computer where I can type quickly with 2 hands. Anyways, this may change. They do provide bank statements in CSV format if you want to import your statement into Sage Accounting which is what I need as I am running my business through SAGE. Finally, you cannot see a running breakdown of your transactions on the app. If you want to see anything you need to click on > Statements and Letters > Account Statements > Month and then you get an instant email with the account statement. Free I might add. But I would like to view my transactions in the app. For the rest, the efficiency of card delivery, the ease of opening the account online, I really am impressed. I do hope they attend to some features mentioned above but so far I'm staying with this bank. Makes you realise how much money is wasted on bank fees.

I have been a strong advocate for Bank Zero and their innovative, problem-solving approach to traditional banking as we come to know and accept it. However, I have lost trust in that strong belief - due to slipping up on the basics.

Not so fast.
You then have to upload several company-related documents via your phone. 
 All these documents reside on your computer.  How do you get these to your phone?  
No use emailing it to BZ - it has to come from your phone according to management!  
Focus on client service by BZ is less than zero to my mind.  No-one to talk to.  Only emails from BZ. 
When a new account is opened, bank management should be on top of their game.  Meet the new client's concerns and be a person he/she can turn to if in doubt.  Beat the other banks.  You have a competitive edge.
BZ has no offices such as conventional banks where a new client could call for assistance.  BZ executives should be particularly sensitive to the client's perception of the service he/she receives.

I have previously sent emails to them to request that the restriction be uplifted but up to now have not had a reply. On trying to withdraw funds from an ATM I was declined and fees charge to me although plenty of funds in the account.
It turns out that in order to  withdraw funds this functionality must be enabled on the app which I can not do as my account is restricted. 
Further to the above there is no way of contacting Bank Zero telephonicaly or an address advertised where the public can contact them  and one must rely on email facilities in the app which are not responded to.
As the founder of this bank is the former CEO of a major bank he and his colleges and staff should hang their heads in shame and either take the bank back to the drawing board or close down as the non ability to contact them telephonicaly or have an address to go to  is the same tactic that scammers use.

Dont be caught like I was go else were, you get what you pay for.
